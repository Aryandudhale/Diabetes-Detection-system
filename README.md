# Diabetes-Detection-system

Diabetes detection using machine learning involves training algorithms on large datasets of diabetes-related medical data, including blood glucose levels, age, family history, and other relevant factors, to identify patterns and make predictions about the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes. There are various machine learning techniques that can be used for diabetes detection, including supervised and unsupervised learning, decision trees, and neural networks. These approaches can aid in early diagnosis and risk assessment, and help with personalized treatment and disease management.
